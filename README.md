# iveely.ml [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Fanping/iveely.ml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Fanping/iveely.ml)
Welcome here , my friends, iveely.ml is a pure machine learning library. 
Iveely is an abbreviation from 'I void everything,except love you'. <br/>
Contact me if you have any questions, [liufanping@iveely.com](mailto:liufanping@iveely.com),or you can submit your questions [here](https://github.com/Fanping/iveely.ml/issues).<br/>

#### (1) How to compile iveely.ml ?
It's easy, just use command 'gradle build', or download the code into your project, feel free to use.

#### (2) Is iveely.ml the full version ?
No, iveely.ml is in research and development, will be in the follow-up work increasingly perfect.

#### (3) What algorithms are currently included ?
It has just started to develop,Currently contains K-means, BP-Neural-Network and so on.
The future will be fully added.

#### (4) What is the code structure ?
It is pure java code, mainly contains the model layer and application layer.<br/>
**model-layer**: contains model-libraries of machine learning. <br/>
**application-layer**: belong to the application layer of the model.

#### (5) The use of the model ?
Do not worry, all the models are through junit test, I also prepared the corresponding example for everyone to use the reference. 
Please pay attention to the file(README.md) under each model.

#### (6) Can I known more about iveely.ml ?
Of course you can, by sending me an email or through the [book](http://www.phei.com.cn/module/goods/wssd_content.jsp?bookid=48359) to learn more. 
But the book is not perfect, I will consider writing a better one later.
